# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to anonymously upload files and share them with others through generated links. The system provides a simple, privacy-focused file sharing solution that doesn't require user registration or authentication, making it ideal for quick file exchanges while maintaining user anonymity.

4. WHEN files reach expiration THEN the system SHALL have a cleanup process to permanently remove expired files from storage

### Requirement 5

2. WHEN upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL show percentage completion and estimated time
3. WHEN upload completes THEN the system SHALL display file name, size, and upload timestamp
4. IF upload fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with retry option

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to only accept safe file types, so that I can share files without security concerns while maintaining system integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to optionally protect my uploaded files with a password, so that only intended recipients can access the shared content.

#### Acceptance Criteria
